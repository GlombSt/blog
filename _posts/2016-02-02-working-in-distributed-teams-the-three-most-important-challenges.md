This post series is a summary of my talk about the challenge working in distributed teams
 [I held at this year's TopConf in Linz](http://topconf.com/linz-2016/trackevent/there-is-no-half-remote-team/).
 
It's a 40 minute talk so I decided to split it into three separate posts, each on focusing on one challenge:

1. [the missing watercooler]({{ site.url }}/working-remote-fix-the-missing-watercooler)
2. [quality together-time]({{ site.url }}/working-remote-quality-together-time)
3. [celebrate successes]({{ site.url }}/working-remote-celebrate-successes)
